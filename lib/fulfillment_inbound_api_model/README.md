## Installation

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build fulfillment_inbound_api_model.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./fulfillment_inbound_api_model-0.1.0.gem
```
(for development, run `gem install --dev ./fulfillment_inbound_api_model-0.1.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'fulfillment_inbound_api_model', '~> 0.1.0'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'fulfillment_inbound_api_model', :git => 'https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'fulfillment_inbound_api_model'

api_instance = AmznSpApi::FulfillmentInboundApiModel::FbaInboundApi.new
shipment_id = 'shipment_id_example' # String | A shipment identifier originally returned by the createInboundShipmentPlan operation.
need_by_date = Date.parse('2013-10-20') # Date | Date that the shipment must arrive at the Amazon fulfillment center to avoid delivery promise breaks for pre-ordered items. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. The response to the getPreorderInfo operation returns this value.
marketplace_id = 'marketplace_id_example' # String | A marketplace identifier. Specifies the marketplace the shipment is tied to.

Used to identify items for which you want labeling requirements and item preparation instructions for shipment to Amazon's fulfillment network. The SellerSKU is qualified by the Seller ID, which is included with every call to the Seller Partner API.  Note: Include seller SKUs that you have used to list items on Amazon's retail website. If you include a seller SKU that you have never used to list an item on Amazon's retail website, the seller SKU is returned in the InvalidSKUList property in the response.
  asin_list: ['asin_list_example'] # Array<String> | A list of ASIN values. Used to identify items for which you want item preparation instructions to help with item sourcing decisions.  Note: ASINs must be included in the product catalog for at least one of the marketplaces that the seller  participates in. Any ASIN that is not included in the product catalog for at least one of the marketplaces that the seller participates in is returned in the InvalidASINList property in the response.
